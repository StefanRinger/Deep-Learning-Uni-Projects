# Deep-Learning-Uni-Projects
A deep learning framework created from scratch just using numpy anc a ResNet model for classifying cracks in solar panels. I created this code for the deep learning course at the FAU University offered by the pattern recognition chair. Thanks to my lab partner Shifa!

## Table of contents:
- 0 Numpy: Basics of working with the numpy library
- 1 Fully Connected: Implementation of a FC layer, basic optimzers etc
- 2 CNN: Implementation of a Convolutional Layer, Pooling and Flatten.
- 3 RNN and Regularization: Implementation of an elman cell and regularization techniques like dropout, batch-normalization, l1...
- 4 ResNet Solar Panel Classifcation: Using Pytorch we build a dataloader that augments the data and gives it to a ResNet model for classification.


Please note: The code may not be complete and will not be maintained. I take zero responsibility for broken code.
